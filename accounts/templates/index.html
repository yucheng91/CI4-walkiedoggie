          <h1>Singapore’s Volunteer-Run Dog Shelter</h1><br>
          <p>SOSD is a volunteer-run organisation dedicated to the welfare of Singapore’s many street dogs. We vehemently oppose the culling of stray animals and believe that there is a more humane way to manage this problem. Our dog shelter exists to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome strays to give them a second chance at life. If you’re an animal lover with a great passion for our canine friends, there are plenty of ways you can participate and help give these beautiful creatures a chance to find their forever home. Whether you want to adopt a dog, be a dog shelter volunteer, donate to our pet shelter, become a sponsor or even a foster parent while our dogs await their forever homes, there are plenty of ways to show you care.</p>

          <h1>Volunteer at our animal shelter by walking with the shelter dog!</h1><br>
          <p>If you don’t have the space or time it takes to care for an animal, there are still ways that you can help. As we are a not-for-profit organisation, we are constantly short of resources and our kennel is stretched to the limit. Choosing to donate to our pet shelter is one way you can help; you can donate money or items and we even have a wish list of things that we need to keep the shelter running on a continual basis. Another option is sponsorship, you can choose a dog to sponsor on a month-to-month basis (min 3 months), which helps to cover the expenses incurred, until they find their forever home.</p>
